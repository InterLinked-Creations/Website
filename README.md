# Interlinked Creations: Website Alpha

This is the base of the Interlinked Creations website.
This includes front-end and back-end activity with a local SQLite database.

## The First Run!
First you will need Node.js on your machine. If you run `npm -v` and `node -v` without an error, chances are that you have Node.js. Otherwise, you need to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).

Once you have Node.js and have downloaded the project, open your terminal and make sure you're on the project folder that contains the **server.js** file. If this is your first time starting the project up, then run these commands: 
```
npm install
node DataBaseSetup.js
node server.js
```

If everything worked, you can open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) on your local browser.

## The Next Run
After the first run, you can just run `node server.js` to start the server.
